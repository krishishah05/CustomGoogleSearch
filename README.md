## Custom Google Search Front-end

This project is a custom front-end interface that replicates key features of Google Search, including regular search, image search, and advanced search functionalities. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience similar to Google's interface.

### Features:

- **Regular Search**: Users can enter a search query and click "Google Search" to be directed to Google's search results for that query.
  
- **Image Search**: The image search page allows users to enter a query and click "Google Image Search" to view Google's image search results.
  
- **Advanced Search**: The advanced search page offers a form with fields similar to Google's advanced search options, including:
  - "All these words"
  - "Exact word or phrase"
  - "Any of these words"
  - "None of these words"
  Clicking "Advanced Search" directs users to Google's search results based on the specified criteria.

- **"I'm Feeling Lucky" Button**: A link is provided on the main search page that mimics Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" functionality. Clicking this link directs users directly to the first Google search result for the query.

### Repository Structure:

- `index.html`: Google Search page with a search bar and link to image search and advanced search.
- `image.html`: Google Image Search page with a search bar.
- `advanced.html`: Google Advanced Search page with input fields for advanced search criteria.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the interface to resemble Google's aesthetics.
- `README.md`: Project documentation explaining the purpose, features, and usage of the custom Google Search front-end.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the main Google Search page.
3. Navigate between different search functionalities using the provided links.
4. Enter search queries and click buttons to perform searches and view results.
